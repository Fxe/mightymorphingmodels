description : |
    Takes a Model/Genome for a 'source' organism and 'morphs' it to the 'target' organism. It keeps reactions from the
     'source' model for which there is at least one matching gene feature, and attempts to remove those in the source model
     that do not have BLAST hits in the second genome. It also adds reactions annotated within the target genome that
     are unique to the target organism. The model is never broken in the process, such that the Biomass reaction and
     any other specified reaction must always carry flux.
